# 🧠 Zero-Shot Prompt (DevOps & Cloud Edition)

## 1. Description

A **Zero-Shot Prompt** is when you ask an AI model to perform a task **without giving any examples** — only clear instructions or context.  
You rely on the model’s **pretrained knowledge** to understand what to do.  

💡 **When to use it:**
- For straightforward tasks where the model’s knowledge is sufficient.  
- When testing how well the model performs without examples.  
- Ideal for **definitions, summaries, configurations, commands, or comparisons**.

## ⚙️ 2. Use Cases (Cloud & DevOps-Focused)

| # | Domain | Example Use Case |
|---|---------|------------------|
| 1 | **AWS** | Generate an IAM policy granting read-only access to S3 buckets. |
| 2 | **Azure** | Describe steps to deploy a web app to Azure App Service using Azure CLI. |
| 3 | **GCP** | Explain the difference between Cloud Run and GKE. |
| 4 | **GitHub** | Write a GitHub Actions YAML file to build and push a Docker image. |
| 5 | **Ansible** | Generate an Ansible playbook to install and configure Nginx. |
| 6 | **Jenkins** | Create a Jenkins declarative pipeline to run tests and deploy to staging. |
| 7 | **Docker** | Write a Dockerfile to build a Python Flask app. |
| 8 | **Kubernetes** | Create a Kubernetes deployment YAML for a Node.js microservice. |
| 9 | **Monitoring Tools** | Explain how to set up Prometheus alerts for CPU usage > 80%. |
| 10 | **Scripting (Python/Bash)** | Write a Bash script to back up logs daily to an S3 bucket. |

## 🧩 3. Template (Reusable)

```text
[ROLE]  
[INSTRUCTION]  

Context: [Brief background about your goal or environment]  
Constraints: [Any specific rules, versions, formats, or naming conventions]  
Output Format: [Specify what you want returned – YAML, code, explanation, steps, etc.]  
```

**Example Structure:**

```text
Act as a DevOps Engineer.
Create a Jenkins declarative pipeline for a Node.js application.

Context: The app is stored in GitHub, and we deploy to AWS EC2.
Constraints: Use pipeline syntax with stages for build, test, and deploy.
Output Format: Jenkinsfile code block.
```

## 💻 4. Examples

### 🟢 Example 1: Simple (AWS S3 Policy)

**Prompt:**

```text
Act as a Cloud Security Engineer.
Write an AWS IAM policy that gives read-only access to all S3 buckets.
Output the result in JSON format.
```

**Expected Output:**

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:Get*",
        "s3:List*"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 🔵 Example 2: Complex (Jenkins CI/CD + Docker + Kubernetes)

**Prompt:**

```text
Act as a DevOps Engineer.
Create a Jenkins declarative pipeline that builds a Docker image for a Python app,
pushes it to Docker Hub, and deploys it to a Kubernetes cluster.

Context: The app repository is on GitHub. Use pipeline stages for checkout, build, push, and deploy.
Constraints: Assume Docker and kubectl are installed on the Jenkins agent.
Output Format: Jenkinsfile.
```

**Expected Output:**

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Checkout') {
            steps {
                git 'https://github.com/user/python-app.git'
            }
        }

        stage('Build Docker Image') {
            steps {
                sh 'docker build -t user/python-app:latest .'
            }
        }

        stage('Push to Docker Hub') {
            steps {
                withCredentials([string(credentialsId: 'dockerhub-token', variable: 'TOKEN')]) {
                    sh 'echo $TOKEN | docker login -u user --password-stdin'
                    sh 'docker push user/python-app:latest'
                }
            }
        }

        stage('Deploy to Kubernetes') {
            steps {
                sh 'kubectl apply -f k8s/deployment.yaml'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## 🧠 (Advanced) Tips to Improve / Combine

| Technique | Description | Example |
|------------|--------------|----------|
| 🧩 **Chain it with “Reasoning” prompts** | Add “Explain your reasoning step-by-step” to improve accuracy. | “Explain why each stage in this pipeline is necessary.” |
| 🧱 **Add role context** | Improves specificity. | “Act as an AWS Solutions Architect.” |
| ⚙️ **Add output format constraints** | Reduces ambiguity in results. | “Output only JSON, no text.” |
| 🚀 **Use for baseline comparison** | Great to test before moving to Few-Shot or CoT prompting. | Compare model performance with and without examples. |

---

## ✅ Summary

| Aspect | Key Takeaway |
|--------|---------------|
| **Core Idea** | No examples given — rely on model knowledge. |
| **When to Use** | Simple, known tasks or for model testing. |
| **Best For** | Configs, scripts, short explanations, YAML/JSON outputs. |
| **Improvement Path** | Upgrade to Few-Shot or Chain-of-Thought prompting for complex workflows. |

##### Description:
Zero-Shot Prompting means giving the model a task or question directly, without any examples or demonstrations.
You rely entirely on the model’s pretrained knowledge and its ability to infer instructions from the context of your request.

##### Template:
<<----------------------Template---------------------->>
<Task or Instruction> 
<Optional Context or Input>

Examples:
- Summarize the following text in one sentence: [Insert text]
- Classify the sentiment of this review: [Insert review]
- Translate this to [Target Language]: [Insert text]
<<----------------------------------------------------------->>

##### Use Cases:
1. Text Classification
→ “Classify the following message as Positive, Neutral, or Negative.”

2. Summarization
→ “Summarize this paragraph in one line.”

3. Creative Writing
→ “Write a short bedtime story about a robot who learns to dream.”

4. Language Translation
→ “Translate this English sentence into Spanish.”

5. Information Retrieval
→ “List three causes of the French Revolution.”

##### Examples:

##### Advance Tips
Add Context
→ “You are an expert historian. List three causes of the French Revolution.”
(This makes the model assume a role, increasing precision.)

Specify Format or Constraints
→ “List exactly three bullet points.”
→ “Respond in JSON format.”

Use "Zero-Shot Chain-of-Thought"
→ Add reasoning cues like “Let’s think step by step.”
→ Helps the model reason before output, even in zero-shot mode.

Combine with Role Prompts
→ “Act as a data analyst and summarize this dataset description in one paragraph.”
